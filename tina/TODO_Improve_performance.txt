Based on the Lighthouse report provided, here is a detailed analysis of the performance problems for https://jeroennisser.netlify.app/.

Executive Summary
The website has a Performance Score of 58 (Mobile), which is considered "Needs Improvement". While the page starts to load quickly (good FCP), the user experience suffers significantly due to a massive delay in displaying the main content.

The primary bottleneck is JavaScript-dependent rendering. The main headline does not appear until the JavaScript bundle has fully loaded and executed, which takes over 11 seconds on a mobile connection.

Key Performance Metrics Analysis
Metric	Value	Status	Analysis
First Contentful Paint (FCP)	0.9s	🟢 Good	The browser paints something (likely the background or navbar) very quickly.
Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)	11.3s	🔴 Poor	Critical Issue. The main text ("Herstel je Lichaam...") takes 11.3s to become visible.
Total Blocking Time (TBT)	670ms	🟠 Avg	The CPU is blocked by heavy script execution, making the page feel unresponsive.
Speed Index	1.3s	🟢 Good	The visual progression of the page frame is generally good, except for the LCP element.
Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)	0.004	🟢 Good	The page is visually stable and doesn't jump around.
Deep Dive: The Core Problems

1. LCP Delay caused by Client-Side Animation (Critical)
The Issue: The Largest Contentful Paint element is the text: <span>Herstel je Lichaam. Vind je Balans terug.</span>.
The Evidence:
The audit shows an Element Render Delay of 10,708ms. This accounts for 95% of the LCP time.
The HTML snippet for this element shows inline styles: style="opacity: 1; filter: blur(0px); transform: none;".
The Diagnosis: This indicates that the text is hidden by default (likely opacity: 0 via CSS) and is waiting for a JavaScript library (likely Framer Motion or similar animation library used in React/Next.js) to hydrate, calculate the animation, and set opacity: 1.
The Impact: Because the JavaScript bundle is large (see below), the browser takes 11 seconds to download and parse the script before it can run the animation code to reveal the text.
2. Excessive JavaScript Payload
The Issue: The site requests 1.8 MB of JavaScript (transfer size). For a mobile device on a 4G network, this is a massive payload.
The Evidence:
Unused JavaScript: Lighthouse flags 961 KiB of code as unused during load.
Large Chunks: Specific files are huge:
.../ca115657...js: 489 KB
.../150-2c...js: 342 KB
.../9dfe07...js: 320 KB
The Impact: This bloats the "Time to Interactive" and "Total Blocking Time". The browser is busy downloading and compiling this code instead of rendering the page content.
3. Main Thread Blocking
The Issue: The browser's main thread is blocked for 2.7 seconds handling tasks, mostly script evaluation.
The Evidence: The long-tasks audit identifies a specific script (...3822...js) that blocks the thread for 580ms alone.
The Impact: Even if the content were visible, the page would feel "frozen" or sluggish to user taps during this processing time.
Recommendations & Fixes

1. Fix LCP (Highest Priority)
You must decouple the visibility of your Hero text from JavaScript execution.

CSS-First Approach: Ensure the main headline is visible via standard CSS immediately upon load.
Remove Entry Animations for LCP: Disable the fade-in/slide-up animation for the H1 tag on mobile devices, or use standard CSS Keyframe animations that run immediately without waiting for React hydration.
Critical CSS: If you must animate, ensure the initial state is visible, or use the priority prop if using Next.js Image components (though this issue here is text-based).
2. Reduce JavaScript Bundle Size
Analyze the Bundle: Use @next/bundle-analyzer to see what is taking up so much space. The chunks ca11... and 150... are suspiciously large.
Tree Shaking: Check if you are importing heavy libraries (like lodash, moment, or full icon packs) when you only need small parts.
Lazy Loading: Use next/dynamic to lazy load heavy components that are below the fold (e.g., the map, carousel, or footer components). They do not need to be in the initial bundle.
3. Server-Side Optimization
Time to First Byte (TTFB): Your server response time is 147ms, which is excellent (likely statically generated via Netlify). Keep this up.
Text Compression: Lighthouse suggests a small saving here, but ensure Brotli/Gzip is enabled for all text assets on Netlify headers (usually automatic).
Summary of Action Plan
Immediate Fix: Change the Hero section text styles so they are visible by default via CSS, removing the dependency on JavaScript animation for visibility. This alone will likely bring your LCP from 11.3s down to ~1.5s.
Optimization: Run a bundle analysis to identify and remove unused JavaScript code to improve TBT and responsiveness.
